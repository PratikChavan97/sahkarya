        <h2>Who are we?</h2>
        <p>
          Sahkarya is a nonprofit organization based in Pune, dedicated to
          bridging educational gaps in underserved communities. Since our
          inception, we have reached hundreds of children with the tools and
          opportunities they need to thrive. Our primary aim is to ensure that
          every child of school going age is gaining a strong and holistic
          educational foundation to become a responsible, compassionate and
          confident citizen of tomorrow.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most Sahakarya's children are from families where there has been
          little or no formal education, where education is not a priority and
          it is a common place for children to drop out of school in order to
          contribute to the family income. Believing in the power of education
          to change lives, a childâ€™s journey at Sahakarya starts at the
          Kindergarten level, continues through school years and supports them
          until they become employable. The focus is always in making learning a
          continuous, joyous and voluntary experience that will help the
          children discover and achieve their true potential and take on the
          future with confidence.
        </p>
