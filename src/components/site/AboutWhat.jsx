        <h2>Program Overview</h2>
        <p>
          Sahakarya's programs have been designed to meet the educational needs
          of children in the low-income communities. For a child, our programmes
          are a journey from Kindergarten through school years towards enhanced
          employability skills. The focus is on making learning a continuous,
          voluntary and joyous experience to enable our children to take on the
          future with confidence as they progress towards their ultimate goal of
          self sufficiency. To know more about the programmes click over the

        <h2>Why We Do It?</h2>
        <p>
          In India today, 4% of our children never start school. 58% do not
          complete primary school. 90% do not complete secondary school. And
          only 10% complete college.
        </p>

        <p>
          Udaan aims at changing these statistics by providing children from
          low-income communities the academic and non-academic support that will
          enable them to stay and succeed in school and realize their true
          potential through continuous learning.{" "}
